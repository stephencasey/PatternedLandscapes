One thing I always thought was pretty neat was emergent behavior in complex systems: individual parts of a system following some simple rule, and producing something complex and unexpected as a result. Patterned landscapes are one example of this, where vegetation forms geometrically intricate patches across a landscape. This project presents a fun, interactive way to play around with some kernel based models that produce these landscape patterns and also learn a little about the theory.
