Interactive app for generating patterned landscapes using a kernel-based model

http://landscape-patterns.stephentcasey.com/

Emergent behavior in complex systems is where individual parts of a system follow some simple rule and produce something complex and unexpected as a result. Patterned landscapes are one example of this, where vegetation forms geometrically intricate patches across a landscape due to self-organization. This project presents a fun, interactive way to play around with some kernel based models that produce these landscape patterns and also learn a little about the theory.
